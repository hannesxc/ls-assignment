# Employee Resource Management App  

Note: Code is a bit wonky since I'm still learning, but a bunch of the required features work. Availability is broken, so is sorting the list through availability (availability states save but can't handle the checkbox). LocalStorage isn't implemented yet either, and I can't really do stuff with the modal or customize it, since I don't know Bootstrap.
